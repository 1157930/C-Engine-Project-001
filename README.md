# 🔥 C-Engine-Project-001: Simple Interest Calculator

Hey there! 👋  
This is my **first mini project in C programming** — a simple interest calculator that takes user input for **Principal, Rate, and Time**, then computes the **Simple Interest** using the formula:

\[
SI = (P × R × T) / 100
\]

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Takes user input for:
- Principal amount 💰  
- Rate of interest (%) 📈  
- Time (in years) ⏳  

✅ Calculates and displays:
- Simple Interest (SI) 💸  
- Total Amount (Principal + SI) 💰  

✅ Uses basic arithmetic operations with `scanf()` and `printf()`  
✅ Perfect beginner project for C language learners!

## 🧠 Formula Used
SI = (P * R * T) / 100
Total Amount = P + SI

🧰 Tools & Tech

Language: C

IDE: Any C compiler (Code::Blocks, VS Code, Turbo C++, etc.)

Platform: Windows / Linux / macOS

📚 What I Learned

Using printf() and scanf() for input/output
